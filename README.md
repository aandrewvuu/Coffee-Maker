# Coffee Maker

As an avid coffee consumer, I always wanted to try different technques to make my coffee. Combine my love for coffee and my passion for engineering, I sought to engineer a coffee machine that would utilize the pour over techinque to consistently create a delicious and flavourful coffee. I will cover a step by step guide as well as share my thought process while tackling this project.

## Preliminary Brainstorming

This is a brief overview of the logic behind this:

## Bill of Materials

| Item | Amount | 
| -----|--------|
|Arduino|1|
|IoT Relay|1|
|Pump|1|
|Kettle|1|
|Thermocouple|1|
|Load cell|1|
|Load cell ADC|1|
|Servo Motor|2|
|Plastic tubing|1|
|Copper Wire|1|
|Gasket|4|
|1/4 inch nuts|4|
|Brass nozzle fitting|1|
|Screws|8|

## Hardware Part

###Preparing the Kettle

1. Using a drill, drill 2 1/4 inch holes at the bottom of the kettle with the holes being seperated by at least 1 inch.
2. Put a rubber gasket on the thermocouple and then stick it into the kettle. Put a rubber gasket on the other side of the thermocouple and a 1/4 inch nut and tighten it so that the thermocouple is soundly installed
3. Similiarly, put a rubber gasket on the 1/4 inch brass nozzle fitting. Stick the fitting into the kettle. Put a rubber gasket on the other side of the brass fitting and a 1/4 inch nut adn tighten it so that the nozzle fitting is secured in place.
